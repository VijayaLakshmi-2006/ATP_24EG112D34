# MERN Stack Development - Week 2 Assignments

Welcome to the documentation for the Week 2 assignments of the MERN Stack ATP program. This week focused on strengthening JavaScript fundamentals and diving into backend development with Node.js and Express.

##  Day 3: Mastering Array Methods
Day 3 was all about learning how to manipulate data efficiently using modern JavaScript array methods. Instead of using old-fashioned loops, we used:

- **`filter()`**: To pick specific items from a list (e.g., finding products in stock).
- **`map()`**: To transform every item in a list (e.g., adding a bonus to salaries).
- **`reduce()`**: To calculate a single value from a list (e.g., finding the grand total of a cart).
- **`find()`**: To quickly locate a specific item.
- **`findIndex()`**: To find the position of an item in a list.

**Real-world scenarios covered:**
Shopping Cart Management
Student Grading System
Employee Payroll
Movie Database Filtering
Bank Transaction History

## Day 4: Modern JavaScript (ES6+) & Async JS
Day 4 introduced more advanced concepts that make JavaScript powerful and easier to write.

### Classes & Objects
We learned how to use **Classes** to create blueprints for objects, making our code more organized and reusable (e.g., a `Book` class for a library).

###  Spread & Rest Operators
- **Spread (`...`)**: Used to copy or merge arrays and objects easily.
- **Rest (`...`)**: Used in functions to handle any number of arguments.

###  Shallow vs. Deep Copy
We explored the difference between a quick copy (Shallow) and a complete independent copy (Deep) using `structuredClone()` to avoid accidental data changes.

### Asynchronous JavaScript
We leaned how to make code wait or run periodically using:
- **`setTimeout()`**: Running code after a delay (like evaluating exam results).
- **`setInterval()`**: Repeating code at intervals (like resending an OTP).

---

## Day 5: Backend with Express.js
Day 5 marked the start of building real servers! We used **Express.js** to create a **REST API** for managing products.

### Key Concepts Covered:
- **Routing**: Creating different "paths" for our application (e.g., `/products`, `/users`).
- **HTTP Methods (CRUD)**:
  - `GET`: Fetching data.
  - `POST`: Adding new data.
  - `PUT`: Updating existing data.
  - `DELETE`: Removing data.
- **Middleware**: Functions that run "in the middle" of a request to perform tasks like logging or security checks.
- **URL Parameters**: Using specific IDs in the URL (like `/products/101`) to find exactly what we need.

## Project Structure
- `day3ass*.js`: Array method exercises.
- `day4ass*.js`: ES6 classes, spread/rest, and timers.
- `day5ass1.js`: Express.js Product API.
- `server.js`: The main entry point for the backend server.
- `req.http`: A file to test all our API endpoints.



#  Week 2 - Intermediate JavaScript (MERN Stack Preparation)

This repository contains Week 2 practice programs focused on advancing JavaScript concepts essential for MERN stack development. The exercises emphasize array methods, modular programming, object-oriented concepts, and asynchronous behavior.

---

##  Files Included

###  Array & Copy Concepts

#### `arrayMethods.js`

* Demonstrates built-in array methods like `map()`, `filter()`, `reduce()`, etc.
* Helps understand functional programming in JavaScript.

#### `arrayCopy.js`

* Explains how to copy arrays.
* Covers methods like spread operator (`...`) and `slice()`.

#### `shallowAnd DeepCopy.js`

* Differentiates between shallow copy and deep copy.
* Shows how object references work in memory.

---

###  Modules & File Structure

#### `modulesWithFiles-task.js`

* Demonstrates modular programming using multiple files.
* Focuses on separating logic for better scalability.

#### `app.js`

* Main entry file.
* Integrates and executes functionality from other modules.

#### `validator.js`

* Contains reusable validation functions.
* Example: input validation logic for better code organization.

---

###  Object-Oriented Programming

#### `classBook.js`

* Introduces JavaScript classes.
* Covers constructors, methods, and object creation.

---

###  Asynchronous JavaScript

#### `timing Functions.js`

* Demonstrates timing functions like:

  * `setTimeout()`
  * `setInterval()`
* Helps understand non-blocking execution in JavaScript.

---

##  Learning Objectives

* Master advanced array operations
* Understand shallow vs deep copy concepts
* Learn modular coding with multiple files
* Practice object-oriented programming (OOP)
* Understand asynchronous behavior using timing functions

---

##  Tech Used

* JavaScript (ES6+)
* Node.js

##  How to Run

1. Install Node.js
2. Navigate to the project folder
3. Run any file using:

```bash
node filename.js
```

Example:

```bash
node app.js


##  Next Step

* Working with APIs (Fetch / Axios)
* Express.js backend development
* MongoDB integration
* Authentication & Middleware
